# Annoying_Virus
A "virus" just to make fun of your friend, it's just annoying, it won't damage or steal anything!

# How it works
when the file is executed it will be copied into the windows startup folder. (it runs as soon as it is ejected) \
Once in the startup folder when the pc is turned on the virus will run.

# What he does
### When the PC is turned on
The virus will turn the pc volume to maximum and play "onii chan".

### Always running
The classic Ctrl C, Ctrl V will not work, the virus will paste a random phrase

### 5 in 5 minutes
The google voice will say a random phrase with the pc sound at maximum
Wifi is disconnected, not turned off, just disconnected, to give a slight lag in games and apps

### 10 in 10 minutes
The coputer will go to the lock screen, making you have to log in again
